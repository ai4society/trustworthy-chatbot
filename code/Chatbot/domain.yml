If you are already registered to vote, you can go to your county elections office to get a SC Voter Registration Card with Photo.

Free DMV ID Cards are also available from the Department of Motor Vehicles.

If you cannot get a Photo ID, bring your non-photo voter registration card with you when leaving to vote.

You may vote a provisional ballot after signing an affidavit stating you have a reasonable impediment to obtaining a Photo ID.  A reasonable impediment is any valid reason, beyond your control, which created an obstacle to obtaining a Photo ID.  Some examples include:  a disability or illness, a conflict with your work schedule, a lack of transportation, a lack of a birth certificate, family responsibilities, a religious objection to being photographed, and any other obstacle you find reasonable.

This ballot will count unless someone proves to the county board of voter registration and elections that you are lying about your identity or having the listed impediment."

  utter_straight_party_voting_work:
  - text: "Whether to vote Straight Party is the first choice a voter must make on a General Election ballot.  Voting straight party is optional.  Each political party that has nominated a candidate appearing on the voters ballot is represented in the straight party selection area.  If a party is selected under straight party, every candidate of that party is automatically selected.

Voters have the option of overriding the straight party vote for any one office by voting for a candidate other than the partys nominee (also known as crossover voting).  While the crossover vote will override the straight party selection for that particular office, the straight party selection will continue to apply to all other offices for which no selection was made.

Voters should be aware that a straight party selection does not apply to nonpartisan offices and questions.  These contests must be voted individually.

As always, voters should carefully review their choices on the review screen before casting their ballot."

  - text: "A candidate may be nominated by more than one political party.  If so, the candidate is listed once for each party by which they are nominated.

This process is sometimes referred to as fusion voting, and candidates are sometimes referred to as fusion candidates.  All votes for fusion candidates go to the candidate.

For example, if candidate A receives 100 votes as the nominee for Party 1 and 100 votes as the nominee for Party 2, the candidate receives a total of 200 votes.  While the candidate receives all votes cast for the candidate, regardless of party, this total is not displayed in election results.  Results are reported separately for each nomination.

Act 150 of 2022 prohibits fusion voting beginning January of 2023.
