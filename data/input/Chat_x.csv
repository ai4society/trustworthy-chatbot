You may vote a provisional ballot after signing an affidavit stating you have a reasonable impediment to obtaining a Photo ID.  A reasonable impediment is any valid reason, beyond your control, which created an obstacle to obtaining a Photo ID.  Some examples include:  a disability or illness, a conflict with your work schedule, a lack of transportation, a lack of a birth certificate, family responsibilities, a religious objection to being photographed, and any other obstacle you find reasonable.
This ballot will count unless someone proves to the county board of voter registration and elections that you are lying about your identity or having the listed impediment."
What happens if I have a Photo ID but don't bring it when voting in person?,"If you dont have your Photo ID with you when voting in person, you may vote a provisional ballot that will count only if you show your Photo ID to your county voter registration office prior to certification of the election (usually Thursday or Friday)."

Your non-photo voter registration card is not necessary to vote unless you are voting under the reasonable impediment exception.  See answer to previous Question What if I dont have one of these Photo IDs? for details.
How does straight party voting work?,"Whether to vote Straight Party is the first choice a voter must make on a General Election ballot.  Voting straight party is optional.  Each political party that has nominated a candidate appearing on the voters ballot is represented in the straight party selection area.  If a party is selected under straight party, every candidate of that party is automatically selected.
Voters have the option of overriding the straight party vote for any one office by voting for a candidate other than the partys nominee (also known as crossover voting).  While the crossover vote will override the straight party selection for that particular office, the straight party selection will continue to apply to all other offices for which no selection was made.
Voters should be aware that a straight party selection does not apply to nonpartisan offices and questions.  These contests must be voted individually.
As always, voters should carefully review their choices on the review screen before casting their ballot."
How is the ballot order determined for candidates and political parties?,"Candidates for partisan offices appear on the ballot in party order.  Party order rotates every two years at the time of the general election.

Visit our candidates page to see the party order for the 2022 General Election.
Candidates for nonpartisan offices are ordered alphabetically by last name.
The write-in space always appears last.
(https://scvotes.gov/candidates/#party-order-on-ballots.)
"
A candidate is listed more than once on my ballot.  Is this correct?,"A candidate may be nominated by more than one political party.  If so, the candidate is listed once for each party by which they are nominated.
This process is sometimes referred to as fusion voting, and candidates are sometimes referred to as fusion candidates.  All votes for fusion candidates go to the candidate.
For example, if candidate A receives 100 votes as the nominee for Party 1 and 100 votes as the nominee for Party 2, the candidate receives a total of 200 votes.  While the candidate receives all votes cast for the candidate, regardless of party, this total is not displayed in election results.  Results are reported separately for each nomination.
Act 150 of 2022 prohibits fusion voting beginning January of 2023.

"
I saw a candidate/member of candidates campaign at my polling place talking to voters.  Can they do that?,"Yes, but there are restrictions:
Inside the polling place:  No campaigning is allowed.  Candidates may be inside the polling place and talk to voters as long as they are not campaigning, intimidating voters, or interfering with the election process.
Within 500 feet of an entrance to a polling place:  Candidates and campaign staff may campaign as long as they are not intimidating voters or interfering with the election process.  However, no campaign literature, signs, or posters are allowed.  Candidates are allowed to wear a badge no larger than 4.25 x 4.25 featuring only the candidates name and office sought.  Candidates must remove their badge upon entering a polling place."
Are there any laws about candidates posting their signs along the roadway?,"Yes, there are several state laws addressing political signs on roadways, as well as county and municipal ordinances.  See SC Code of Laws Sections 57-25-10, 57-25-140, and 7-25-210.
Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the entity that maintains the road (state, county, and municipality) to enforce applicable sign laws.
(https://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/statmast.php)
"
"A candidate is definitely campaigning while in the polling place, or there is campaign material within 500 feet of the entrance.  What can I do?",Inform a poll manager immediately so the issue can be resolved. See answer to question below to Where can I report an issue or file a complaint about the election?
Can candidates or their representatives take people to the polls to vote?,"Yes.  It is permissible for any person, even a candidate, to give a voter a ride as long as it is being done solely to help facilitate voting.  However, no one can offer a voter anything of value in exchange for voting."
Can I take my child with me to vote?,Yes.  Minor children (under age 18) of a voter may accompany the voter in the voting booth.
Are ballot selfies legal?  Can I take a picture of my ballot and share it with others?,No.  State law prohibits anyone from showing their ballot to another person (S.C. Code of Laws Section 7-25-100).  The use of cameras is not allowed inside the polling place.
"When I left the polls, I was asked to participate in an ""exit poll."" Is this legal?","Exit polls are legal and participation is voluntary.  They are NOT conducted by the State Election Commission or county election offices.  Exit polls may not be conducted inside the polling place, and voters should not be approached as they enter the polling place.  If you feel threatened or intimidated by a pollster, report it immediately to the poll clerk."
When and where will results be reported?,"Unofficial results will be reported by the State Election Commission (SEC) on election night at scVOTES.gov.  Results are reported as the SEC receives them from each county elections offices.
Results are also reported locally at each polling place and at county elections offices.
(https://scvotes.gov/)
"
What are official results?,"Results of the election are certified by election officials after it has been determined that all votes have been counted accurately and completely. Once certified, results are official.
County boards of voter registration and elections certify results by the Friday following election day."
When is a recount necessary?,"When the difference between any winning candidate and any other non-winning candidate is 1% or less of the total votes cast for all candidates for that office, a recount is mandatory."
How can I trust the accuracy of the results?,"Election officials work to ensure a strong and resilient election infrastructure that will continue to serve South Carolinians in the face of any adversity.

"
Is the voting system connected to the internet? ,"No, the voting system is never connected to the internet. Computers used to tabulate votes, BMDs, and ballot scanners used in South Carolina are not even capable of being connected to the internet."
Where can I report an issue or file a complaint about the election?,"Any issues or complaints about an issue at a voting location should first be addressed to a poll manager.  Poll managers may be able to quickly resolve the issue.
If not resolved at the voting location, or if the issue or complaint is regarding some other aspect of the election, voters should contact their county elections office as soon as possible."
How can I help? ,"Apply to be a poll manager today. State and county election officials work hard all year to ensure that elections are secure and run smoothly, but we cant do it alone. Poll managers play an important role in conducting fair and impartial elections.
