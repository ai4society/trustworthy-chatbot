# SafeChat: An Architecture for Building Trustworthy Collaborative Assistants

SafeChat is an architecture that aims to provide a safe and secure environment for users to interact with AI chatbots in trust-sensitive domains. It uses a combination of neural (learning-based, including generative AI) and symbolic (rule-based) methods, together called a neuro-symbolic approach, to provide known information in easy-to-use consume forms that are adapted from user interactions (provenance). The chatbots generated are scalable, quick to build and is evaluated for trust issues like fairness, robustness and appropriateness of responses.

## üéØ Key Features
- Scalable architecture
- Safe and traceable chatbot interactions
- Data agnostic

## üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)


## üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai4society/trustworthy-chatbot
   cd trustworthy-chatbot
   ```
2. **Create and activate a conda virtual environment**
   ```bash
   conda create --name safechat_venv python==3.8
   conda activate safechat_venv
   ```
3. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Provide question answer pairs for your use case**

    * Create a new `data/input/<file-name>.csv` file with your desired question answer pairs or use the existing one. Your CSV should have a column called *Question* and another one called *Answer*. Optionally, if you would like for your chatbot to give traceable responses to your user, include columns *Timestamp* with [UNIX timestamps](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) corresponding to the date of the response and *Source* with strings which may be URLs or names of the organization which procured the response.
    * Create a new `data/input/DNA.csv` that is a single column list of questions that you would like your chatbot to avoid answering. Ensure that the heading of this column is *Questions*
5. **Process your data and configure the chatbot using the RASA Open Source framework**

    * Extract the intent for user queries: `python code/extract_intent.py` By default, this will read `data/input/Chat.csv`, however, you can specify a different csv file in the `data/input` directory with the `-f` or `--file` argument:`python code/extract_intent.py -f Election_QA.csv` 
      * Saves to `data/input/Chat_intent.csv` 
    * Paraphrase all user queries: `python code/paraphraser.py`
      * Saves to `data/input/paraphrased.json`
    * Configure directory for RASA Open Source: `python code/configure_rasa.py`
      * Saves to `Chatbot` directory. Deletes existing `Chatbot` by default, so save in different location if you would like to save the configuration.
6. **Train and converse with your chatbot**

    * Navigate to chatbot directory: `cd Chatbot` 
    * Train chatbot: `rasa train`
    * Converse with trained chatbot: `rasa shell`
    * Optionally, if you would like your chatbot to handle some business-logic for some queries, you may utilize the [RASA Actions](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/actions/)
